# FON & FNT demo

FON is a resource container which only contains font resources

FNT is a font resource file

In this demo, only the FNT format is usable. I still haven't solved the FON container format due to the lack of documentation out there

Included in this demo are the `8514oem`, `CGA8`, `Fixedsys` and `System` fonts from Windows 3.1


## How to extract an FNT from FON
- Download & open **Fony**
- Open any Microsoft's FON file (many can be obtained from Windows fonts folder)
- Choose the font that you want to export from the **Fonts** menu
- Save as FNT font resource
