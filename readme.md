# Game framework for Turbo Pascal 7.0

My goal is to create something like a fantasy computer such as PICO-8 and TIC-80 but uses Turbo Pascal because I believe it's fast enough & easier than C

Included unit files:

- `GAME.PAS`: Program starting point
- `BITMAP.PAS`: Utility for BMP files
- `CONV.PAS`: Common conversion features
- `LOGGER.PAS`: Debug logger
- `VGA.PAS`: Utility for VGA access
