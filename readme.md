A game framework for Turbo Pascal 7.0. The name comes from **Positron** and **1992** (the year in which TP7 was released). I know it sounds kinda obscure, because it **is** an obscure piece of tech especially for game dev.

My goal is to create something like a fantasy computer such as PICO-8 and TIC-80 but uses TP7 because I believe it's fast enough & easier than C.

I'm also inspired by [LoveDOS](https://github.com/rxi/lovedos) (also, the working fork with the audio working: https://github.com/SuperIlu/lovedos).
